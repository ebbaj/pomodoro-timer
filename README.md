# Pomodoro Timer

Hyper Island - The First App module - Brief 1. 

### Brief
- Create a pomodoro timer using React fundamentals (like State, Props, Components, Conditional Rendering, Life Cycle Events). 
- Minimum requirements: should be able to start the timer, it should count down from 25 minutes to 0 seconds, when the timer is done - stop the countdown, reset timer and show an alarm, make it accessible, need to use a framework like React.
- Examples of extra tasks: make a nice design, add break time (usually 5 minutes + triggered automatically), possible to change timer length.

### Goals
Deliver a finished pomodoro timer with (at least) the minimum requirements. This was my first real React project except from following a few smaller tutorials. Therefore my main goal was to learn the basics of React.

### Solution
I created a pomodoro timer using Create React App. It counts down from 25 minutes to 0 seconds and triggers a break time of 5 minutes automatically. You can change the session time and the break time. There is a sound when the timer is up. 

### Learnings
- React fundamentals (when to use state, how to send elements with props, when and why state lifting is needed, an understanding of how to create functional components). 
- How to use moment.js library to convert seconds in the timer into minutes. 

### Tech Stack
- React
- CSS
- moment.js
